# ✨ Framer Website Visual and Layout Concept ✨
- Overall vibe:
    - Clean, bright, bold.
    - Playful use of colored blocks and frames (nod to what the app actually does!)
    - Slightly asymmetrical grid layouts, like a creative collage.
    - Movement and layering to create depth without overwhelming the visitor.

Layout Sketch (scrolling down):
- Hero Section
    - Big white background block.
    - Title text:
        - Frame Your Shots.
        - Keep Their Impact.
    - Floating image of a framed Instagram post mockup (angled slightly for 3D effect).
    - Two big buttons:
    - [Download] [View on GitHub]
    - Background: splashes of soft colors (Instagram sunset shades).
- Featured Examples
    - Block grid layout
    - 3–4 framed images showing different styles: simple white border, colorful background, blurred background.
    - Some blocks are images, others are text like:
        - “No more awkward crops!”
        - “Customizable to match your style.”
- How It Works
    - A step-by-step slider:
        - Pick your image
        - Choose your frame color
        - Preview
        -   Export & post!
    - Each step has its own colored tile, with small icon illustrations (camera, palette, preview screen, upload cloud).

- About the App
    - Simple text block:
        - Framer is a lightweight, open-source app for Android. No ads. No tracking. Just clean, gorgeous frames.
        - A few small feature highlights (with icons):
